I am Prateek, an enthusiastic and driven final-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Lovely Professional University (LPU), India. With a keen passion for leveraging AI to solve real-world problems, I have progressively built a foundation of knowledge and practical experience across machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and DevOps tools.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve consistently sought to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and hands-on application. I have completed several high-impact training programs and certifications, including IBM’s Machine Learning Summer Training, where I developed a strong understanding of core ML algorithms, and a “Build Your Own Chatbot” course from Cognitive Class, which helped me dive deeper into conversational AI. These programs enhanced my understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and chatbot frameworks.

My work extends into research and industry-focused projects, where I’ve applied my skills to diverse domains. One of my most notable academic achievements is the publication of a research paper titled “Fine-tuning Pre-trained BERT and RoBERTa Models for Text Classification and Generation”. This paper explores the nuances of adapting transformer-based language models using Hugging Face Transformers, achieving high accuracy on tasks like sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset and emotion detection using the SetFit dataset. It involved fine-tuning using both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, customizing model heads, optimizing training parameters, and evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

In another impactful project, I worked on “Podcast Listening Time Prediction”, a regression-based machine learning model designed to forecast listener engagement in minutes. Using techniques such as feature engineering, LightGBM modeling, and Scikit-learn pipelines, I built and validated models that provided valuable insights into user behavior analytics. This experience gave me deep exposure to real-world datasets and the end-to-end ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and feature selection to model tuning and evaluation.

My passion for computer vision led me to explore image-based problem-solving through projects such as “Apple Disease Detection Using Fuzzy Set Operations and Otsu’s Method in Image Processing”. This project involved image segmentation, noise removal, and region classification using fuzzy logic and thresholding techniques, with potential applications in smart agriculture. I also started working on a related idea in the agricultural space — detecting fungal infections on litchi fruits — using OpenCV and custom CNN architectures.

Currently, I serve as an AI Intern at Outlier, where I contribute to diverse AI model training projects across industries like environmental monitoring and software development. My responsibilities include data annotation, quality assurance, and active collaboration on training workflows. Here, I utilize Python extensively alongside web-based annotation tools and project management platforms, ensuring data readiness for supervised learning pipelines. My work at Outlier has significantly improved my understanding of dataset curation, annotation integrity, and the role of human-in-the-loop systems in machine learning.

Simultaneously, I am diving deep into DevOps and cloud engineering under the mentorship of Rahul Maheshwari, Founder of LinuxSocials and an industry veteran with experience at Adobe and Google. This rigorous training includes hands-on experience with Linux, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, LLMs, and agentic AI systems. This full-stack exposure to AI engineering infrastructure equips me with the skills required to deploy scalable ML models and manage production-grade systems — a critical edge for modern ML engineers.

Another domain I explored is cybersecurity. I completed the Passive Reconnaissance module on TryHackMe, gaining familiarity with OSINT techniques such as WHOIS lookups, DNS queries, and web crawling. This foundational knowledge contributes to a broader understanding of data privacy, ethical hacking, and security-aware software development — especially relevant when working with sensitive data in ML systems.

In terms of academic support, I’ve had the opportunity to receive mentorship and collaboration on research efforts from my professors, particularly in fine-tuning and evaluating models like TrOCR (Transformer-based OCR). I experimented with TrOCR using datasets like IAM and Imgur5K for handwriting recognition. My focus was on optimizing models for a low Character Error Rate (CER ≤ 7%) and Word Error Rate (WER ≤ 15%). This involved configuring model checkpoints, early stopping, freezing encoder layers, and managing data input formats during fine-tuning — giving me practical exposure to real-world NLP+CV hybrid problems.

In addition to my technical skills, I have demonstrated strong communication and presentation abilities. I delivered a presentation on “Campaign Planning and Virtual Reality for Delivering the Digital Customer Experience”, focusing on digital marketing strategies within the tourism and hospitality industry. This involved analyzing the integration of VR into campaign planning, showcasing how immersive technologies can transform customer engagement.

I also have experience working on E-commerce product recommendation systems, where I applied collaborative filtering and content-based methods to personalize user experiences. Another project involved car price prediction, leveraging regression models to estimate vehicle value based on features like brand, year, mileage, and fuel type. These experiences enhanced my proficiency in pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and advanced regression techniques.

My long-term goal is to become a Machine Learning or AI Software Engineer, particularly in research-driven or product-focused environments in the USA. I am passionate about solving impactful problems using AI, and I constantly strive to refine my abilities in model design, experimentation, and deployment.

With a solid foundation in core AI principles, hands-on experience in diverse ML projects, published research, and a clear vision for the future, I am prepared to take on challenging roles in the AI/ML industry. I look forward to contributing to innovative teams, continuously learning, and developing solutions that make a real difference.
